# Swiftent
Swiftent is here to standardize a way to put your content into your views or other containers

## Reason
### Why
Because I and, probably, you also looking a way to have standard way to define content for some classes and their actual appliance.
UIKit has a lot of classes those are customazed from the properties, but they don't have a shared one method and container that could be applied with the same pattern. I want to change it.

### How
By creating a tool that defines a good enough expectations for you Contentable class about how they should be set up.

## Example


## Installation


### CocoaPods
```swift
pod 'Swiftent'
use_frameworks!
```

### Manual
Copy Swiftent source files to your Xcode project


## Rationale behind the project
Among many project I've developed I found that there a lot of ways to customize UIKit and 3rd party classes, and each person doing it how they like it. But when it comes to large projects person's different habbits conflicts with each others and it becomes to be annoying. So I decided to declare a one single way to customize UIKit classes (as well as others if anyone want to) which I expect be good enough for use.
